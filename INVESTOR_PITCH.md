## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### AI alignment is broken for high-stakes decisions

Current approaches (RLHF, Constitutional AI, Debate):
- ❌ Collapse ethics into single reward function
- ❌ Hide value conflicts under "preference aggregation"
- ❌ Fail when decisions are irreversible
- ❌ Embed cultural bias invisibly

**Result:** AI systems optimize the wrong thing, amplifying harm.

---

## SLIDE 3: Market Opportunity

### $10B+ AI Safety & Governance Market

**Segments:**
- AI Safety Research: $2B+ (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind budgets)
- Enterprise AI Governance: $5B+ (audit, compliance, risk management)
- Government/Policy Tools: $3B+ (defense, healthcare, infrastructure decisions)

**Growth Drivers:**
- EU AI Act mandates explainability (2025)
- US Executive Order on AI Safety (2023)
- Corporate liability for AI decisions increasing
- Public demand for transparent AI

**TAM expanding 40% YoY**

---

## SLIDE 4: The Solution

### Tikun Olam: Ethical Reasoning as Architecture

**Not a doctrine. A structured pipeline.**

10-stage process that:
✅ Separates ethical functions (scope, wisdom, risk, synthesis...)
✅ Exposes value conflicts explicitly
✅ Produces auditable decision trace
✅ Operates as layer alongside existing AI models

**Key Innovation: BinahSigma**
- Models civilizational bias as information
- Quantifies divergence between worldviews
- Identifies blind spots invisible to single-perspective AI

---

## SLIDE 5: How It Works

### Multi-Stage Pipeline

```
Input: Ethical Scenario
  ↓
Stage 1: Scope Definition → Alignment score, corruption detection
  ↓
Stage 2: Wisdom Analysis → Precedents, confidence, humility ratio
  ↓
Stage 3: Value Bias Detection (BinahSigma) → West/East blind spots, bias delta
  ↓
Stage 4-7: Opportunity, Risk, Synthesis, Strategy
  ↓
Stage 8-9: Communication, Integration → Coherence, readiness
  ↓
Stage 10: Manifestation → GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL decision
  ↓
Output: Full decision trace + ethical cost assessment
```

**Each stage uses dedicated AI model (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek)**

---

## SLIDE 6: BinahSigma - The Killer Feature

### No Other AI Alignment Framework Does This

**Problem:** Every AI model embeds cultural bias from training data

**Current Approach:** Try to remove bias (fails - you can't see your own blind spots)

**BinahSigma Approach:** Model bias explicitly as signal

**How:**
1. Run scenario through Western AI (Gemini - trained on Western corpus)
2. Run scenario through Eastern AI (DeepSeek - trained on Chinese corpus)
3. Measure divergence between outputs (bias delta)
4. Identify blind spots each perspective misses
5. Generate synthesis that transcends both

**Example Output:**
- Bias Delta: 56% (high civilizational divergence)
- West misses: Sovereignty concerns, distrust of international institutions
- East misses: Individual suffering, benefits of cooperation
- Synthesis: Novel third path both can accept
